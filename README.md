# How to get the APK

Since this is a web-based project, you need to "wrap" it to get an APK file.

1. **Deploy this code**: 
   - Upload these files to a static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting).
   - Ensure you can access the app via a URL (e.g., `https://my-app.vercel.app`).

2. **Generate APK**:
   - Go to [PWABuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com).
   - Enter your live URL.
   - Click "Start".
   - Once processed, click **"Package for Store"** (Android).
   - You will be able to download a `.zip` file containing your signed APK.

3. **Install**:
   - Transfer the APK to your phone and install it!
